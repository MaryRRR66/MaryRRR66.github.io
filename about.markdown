# MissClick's Tech Hub

Welcome to my website where I share useful or interesting info about technology, Big Data management, cybersecurity, data analysis, and more. There are some useful scripts, articles, and resources for anyone interested in these fields.

## Contents
- **Scripts**: Automate boring stuff with simple scripts.

I am a technology enthusiast with a strong interest in how technology, particularly Big Data management, cybersecurity, and data analysis, can make our lives simpler and more stress-free, both on personal and global levels. This website is a collection of my work and resources that I have found useful. I hope you will find them helpful too!
 
Feel free to explore and learn from the scripts or articles provided here. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact/).

*English is not my first language. Also, the site is currently under construction while I'm learning how to operate it, so some errors might pop up.*
