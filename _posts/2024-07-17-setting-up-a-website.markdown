## Why would I want my own cozy piece of internet?

- **Share What You Are Passionate About:** 
  - Because nothing says "I'm cool" like explaining the intricacies of your [Guinness record 'Do not disturb' signs collection][dnd-collection] or [knowledge about shoelaces][shoelace-knowledge] to the entire internet. #NerdFameAchieved

[shoelace-knowledge]: https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ "Ian's Shoelace Site"

- **Organize Your loose ideas into a knowledge base:** 
  - It's like having a second brain online, but one that doesn't forget where you left that thing (??it was here a moment ago).
    
    

- **For the sake of learning how to do it:** 
  - Knowledge is power, and power corrupts. So technically, by making a website, you're on your way to becoming an evil overlord. You're welcome.
    
    

- **Show Your Presence Online so People Can Reach Out to You:** 
  - A personal website can make you stand out to potential employers and like-minded people.
