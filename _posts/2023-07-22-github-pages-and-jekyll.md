## Why Choose GitHub Pages and Jekyll?

GitHub Pages and Jekyll offer several advantages:

- **Cost:** Both services are free to use.
- **Version Control:** Keep track of changes to your site with Git.
- **Customization:** High degree of customization with Jekyll's templating system.
- **Static Site:** Faster loading times and improved security compared to dynamic sites.

### Static vs. Dynamic Websites

- **Static Websites:** Content is pre-built and served as-is, resulting in faster load times and improved security.
- **Dynamic Websites:** Content is generated on-the-fly based on user interactions, allowing for more complex functionality but can be slower and more vulnerable.

## Ingredients 

- **Git:** Version control system to manage your code. 
- **GitHub Account:** To host your repository and website.
- **Ruby and Jekyll:** To build and manage your site.
- **Text Editor:** For writing and editing your code (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).
- **computer with web connection** -(specify a little more, add links  to those tools, make funny/abstract comparisons to things that are more easily to relate in the real world )

## Tutorial: Setting Up Your Website
