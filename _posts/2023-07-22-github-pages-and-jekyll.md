## Why Choose GitHub Pages and Jekyll?

GitHub Pages and Jekyll offer several advantages:

- **Cost:** Both services are free.
- **Version Control:** Keep track of changes to your site with Git, similar to having a time-traveling diary for your code.
- **Customization:** High degree of customization with Jekyll's templating system, like being able to redecorate your room anytime you want.
- **Static Site:** Faster loading times and improved security compared to dynamic sites.

### Static vs. Dynamic Websites

- **Static Websites:** Content is pre-built and served as-is, resulting in faster load times and improved security. Think of it like a pre-packaged meal that's ready to go.
- **Dynamic Websites:** Content is generated on-the-fly based on user interactions, allowing for more complex functionality but can be slower and more vulnerable. Imagine a chef cooking a fresh meal to order, which can take more time and effort.
