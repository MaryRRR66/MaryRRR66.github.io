So this is a problem that has been bugging me for quite some time. I often find myself adding a plethora of new videos to my "Watch Later" playlist, only to never actually watch them. As the playlist grows longer and longer, I forget why I added them in the first place and lose interest in watching them altogether. Unfortunately, YouTube lacks an option to clear this list full of regrets with just a single click; you’d have to remove each video one by one, which would take an eternity.
